# Mood Barometer
A sentiment analysis tool for twitter feeds

HOW DOES IT WORK:
The app retrives tweets from Twitter using the Twitter API, the data is then processed using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques, formatted and passed to the client side.

It has been created in the form of web application.
The client side is written in HTML, CSS, pure JavaScript and React js with a small addition of jQuery.
The server side is written in Python and Flask.
